<p style="font-family:century gothic;">My father name <b>Mohamad Najib bin Hanapi.</b> He is 49 years old.<b> My dad is my real hero because he is the most special person in my life.</b> During weekdays we work hard & spend maximum time working at his office. He is amongst the top ranked employee of his company & has won many awards for the same. He tries his best to keep our family happy. He works hard to make money for our family. <ins>He loves me a lot & always tries to cheer me up whenever I am in a sad mood.</ins>
He has always taught me good values & not spoiling me by buying me all the things that I wanted. But at the same time he has gifted me many things that I always wish to have. My Dad has always tried his level best to make me a good human being. I am his only son.</p>

<p><p style="font-family:century gothic;"> My mother name is <b>Norhayati Bt Mansor.</b> My mother is always very good to me and so valuable that sometimes I feel like I have no words to describe her. I have been told by many of my friends that I never really say what I feel, and the reason for this is because it is very hard for me to express my feelings. Every time I’m in a situation that I have to express my feelings, I feel like my emotions are caged. <b>The love I have for her is like a rose of eternity; it will never die, but unlike a rose, it will prick not only through my skin, but through my heart and soul.</b> There are even some times when my mother questions if I love her because I hardly ever show her. Even though I still haven’t really expressed how I feel about my mother, I now have the pleasure to speak my mind. Since I still struggle to express my feelings to her, I decided to describe everything that I love about my precious mother in written words. 
<p style="font-family:century gothic;"> Every time I see my mother I have the benefit of taking in her beauty. My Mother’s light brown eyes are bright and lovely so that the richness of her mind and soul there shines. They flash red when right feels wrong to her. These eyes also glow with warmth and tender lights of love. Her abundant black curls fall softly on her beautiful face and feel softly upon my cheeks whenever I hug her. She has loving hands that are so gentle, so kind, so soft that have toiled smoothly through all the years. The three great smiles that she has are <i><b>1)a radiant smile that spreads such joy and sunshine on all that share her happy heavenly life, 2)a smile that hides the pain of heart and soul, and 3)a smile that lightens life’s so bitter trials and brings such calm and peace to heavy hearts.</i></b>Her beautiful face has shone so pure and tranquil above my head through all my life and dreams. The light brown eyes, the abundant curls, the smiles, the silky smooth skin all blend serenely to form a lovely face. </p>

<p><p style="font-family:century gothic;"> I have an elder brother name <b>Mohamad Amirul Amin.</b> He is 24 years old. He is a good brother indeed a good friend of mine. He is so organized, systematic and has great value and i learn all these values from him. Through at many times, we do fight and quarrel, he is the best. One minute fight we like cats and dogs and the next minute we are so much in reunion that i have seen my mom stare at us suprise.</p> 

<p><p style="font-family:century gothic;"> Then, i also have two younger sisters. My first younger sister name <b>Norsyamira.</b> She is 17 years old. My sister is my best friend, we talk about everything. She knows all my little secrets that I would never think about telling my mom, and I know that when I tell her that it is safe with her because that’s the kind of friendship we have. If I didn’t have my sister in my life right now, I honestly don’t know what I’d do, I’d be lost without her. We are so close that we can finish each others sentences. My dearest younger sister name <b>Norsyafa Azzalia.</b> She 1 years old. She brings happiness to my family. Her smile, her laugh, even her cute face will make the whole family become happy.

<p><p style="font-family:century gothic;"> Lastly is my younger brother. His name is <b>Mohamad Aiman. </b> He 12 years old and one of the most compassionate and caring people I know. More so than most adults even. He has helped me out so much through out my life and I don't think he has realized how much I truly care about him. I am blessed with my brother who is younger to me. </p>
